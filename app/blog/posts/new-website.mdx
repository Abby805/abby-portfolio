Today marks the launch of a new-and-hopefully-improved site. For now, its design
remains extremely similar to the previous iteration, but over the past few weeks
I've rebuilt it from the ground up, for two main reasons:

1. I wanted an excuse to tinker with Next.js
1. I wanted somewhere to blog that was fully under my control, without relying 
on a third-party ecosystem like Medium

As of right now, the site is running Next.js version 15.2.0-canary.66, and blog 
posts are written in markdown. It uses vanilla CSS modules, mostly because it's
been a while since I worked on a simple enough project that SCSS or CSS-in-JS 
weren't a foregone conclusion. Good old-fashioned CSS has come a long way in
that time, and I wanted to re-acquaint myself with exactly what it can do these days
without the help of a million dependencies.

There are still many features and improvements I want to make to the site over 
the next few months, but I'm pretty pleased with this as a jumping-off point.
