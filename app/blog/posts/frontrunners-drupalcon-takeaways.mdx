summary: 'Neat things I saw and learned at Frontrunners JS and DrupalCon Atlanta 2025'
---

In the past week, I've been lucky enough to attend two fantastic (though wildly
different) tech conferences: [Frontrunners JS](https://frontrunners.tech/) in
Arlington, VA and [DrupalCon North America](https://events.drupal.org/atlanta2025) 
in Atlanta, GA. 

While I want to dive much further into many of the topics that came up at these
events, I'm also as exhausted as you'd expect from two conferences in a week. So
in the interest of striking while the iron is hot, here's a high-level overview
of just a few of the cool things I learned (to be followed soon with a few more
detailed writings).

## Development Stuff

1. Something about SDC, UI Patterns (https://www.drupal.org/project/ui_patterns),
the componentization of Drupal theming and tying it into my BoF
1. Something about animation workflows https://www.viget.com/articles/building-motion-for-the-web-process-toolkit/ 
1. Going to talks you wouldn't normally choose (single-track etc)
1. A11y stuff about `outline-color: transparent` instead of `outline: none` 
makes it visible for users with windows high-contrast mode.
1. Modal and accordion and select styling
1. Game dev in typescript (sprites!)
1. Type-safe custom CSS properties

## Bonus: People Stuff

1. Getting clients to speak for you
1. Teamwork of dev and sales
1. People CARE (#nohostforhate)
1. Talking to people NOT about work (coffee BoF, hanging out with coworkers etc.)
