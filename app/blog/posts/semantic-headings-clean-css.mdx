## The Challenge

Let's say a designer gives you a style guide with styles for heading levels one 
through six. The h1 styles are the largest, and they get progressively
smaller until you reach h6, maybe following some sort of nice vertical 
rhythm. 

So you set up some default styles:

```css
h1 {
  font-size: 44px;
  font-family: 'Crimson Text', serif;
}

h2 {
  font-size: 36px;
  font-family: 'Crimson Text', serif;
  font-weight: 700;
  text-transform: uppercase;
}

h3 {
  font-size: 24px;
  color: #333333;
}

/* etc. */
```

It seems simple enough, until you start getting mockups of actual pages. Maybe 
h4 styles are being used in places that semantically ought to use an h2. 
Maybe some content types use h2 styles for their h1 title. In almost 20 
years of building websites, every project I've ever worked on has skipped heading 
level styles _somewhere_ on the site for aesthetic reasons.

As the developer, how do you handle this? The easiest and tempting answer is to 
simply use whichver HTML tag matches the style on the mockup. But accessibility 
and semantic HTML require that headings proceed in order, without skipping 
levels.<sup><a href="#cite-1">1</a></sup> You don't want to confuse screen 
readers or hamper your site's SEO by taking this shortcut.

So maybe you add some classes to let you override the default styles. This might
look slightly different if you're using a preprocessor like SCSS or a CSS-in-JS 
solution, but the result is something like this:

```css
h1, .h1 {
  /* styles here */
}

h2, .h2 {
  /* styles here */
}

h3 , .h3 {
  /* styles here */
}

/* etc. */
```

This is a common approach, and allows us apply any class to any tag, like so:

```html
<h2 class="h3">
  An H2 cleverly disguised as an H3!
</h2>
```

At first glance, this solves our problem. In practice, though, it only works if
every one of our heading tags has all the same properties set. In our original 
example, the `h2` selector has values for `font-family`, `font-weight`, and 
`text-transform`, but the `.h3` selector does not (presumably because we wanted 
`h3` to inherit the defaults from `body`). Because not all of the `h2` properties 
are overridden, though, `<h2 class="h3">` will wind up rendering with a 
combination of styles deriving from `h2` and `.h3`.

```css
h2, .h2 {
  font-size: 36px;
  font-family: 'Crimson Text', serif;
  font-weight: 700;
  text-transform: uppercase;
}

h3, .h3 {
  font-size: 24px;
  color: #333333;
}

/* Computed styles for h2.h3 */
.frankenheading {
  font-size: 24px;
  font-family: 'Crimson Text', serif;
  font-weight: 700;
  text-transform: uppercase;
  color: #333333;
}
```

That's not the desired effect. You _could_ get around this by making sure that 
each property defined on _any_ of your heading styles is explicitly defined on 
_all_ of your heading styles, but that throws the entire concept of "Don't 
Repeat Yourself (DRY)" out the window, robs CSS of the "cascade" it's named for, 
and frankly sounds like a giant headache.

## The Solution

In most of my recent projects, I've avoided the messiness of overriding default
heading styles by **not defining default styles for heading elements at all.**
And no, we're not going to have to redefine our styles for every heading tag on
the site, either.

These code examples use [Emotion](https://emotion.sh/docs/introduction) on React
components, but you could adapt the same principle to work with almost any 
CSS-in-JS setup.

First, define all of your heading styles as variables. For simplicity's sake, 
I've named each one to match the heading tag they match with most of the time 
(the one they'd go with in a style guide).

```js
# src/styles/global.js

export const h1 = css`
  font-size: 44px;
  font-family: 'Crimson Text', serif;
`

export const h2 = css`
  font-size: 36px;
  font-family: 'Crimson Text', serif;
  font-weight: 700;
  text-transform: uppercase;
`

export const h3 = css` {
  font-size: 24px;
  color: #333333;
}

# etc.
```

Next, we're going to set up a JSX component that will render headings. It's 
going to accept three props: 

* `text` is the content that appears between the heading's opening and closing
tags. For purposes of this example, I'm limiting it to a simple string, but you
could use anything here, including `children`.
* `level` will be an integer from 1 through 6, corresponding to the HTML tag we
want to render (`<h1>`, `<h2>`, etc.) 
* `levelStyle` will also be an integer from 1 through 6, but will correspond to
which of the styles defined in the previous step we want to use. We'll make this
prop optional, and set things up so that if it's left blank the style will fall
back to the same as the tag level.

```ts
// src/components/Heading.tsx
import { jsx } from "@emotion/react";
import { h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, h6 } from '../styles/global';

type HeadingProps = {
  text: string
  level: number
  levelStyle?: number
}

const Heading = ({ text, level, levelStyle, ...props }: HeadingProps) : JSX.Element => {
  const styleLevel = levelStyle ?? level;
  const headingStyles = [h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, h6];
  const visualStyle = headingStyles[styleLevel - 1];
  const HeadingTag = jsx(
    `h${level}`,
    {
      css: visualStyle,
      ...props,
    },
    text
  );

  return HeadingTag;
};

export default Heading;
```

We can then use our new Heading component in pages, templates, or other 
components like so:

```ts
<Heading
  text="An H2 cleverly disguised as an H3!"
  level={2}
  levelStyle={3}
/>

// or:
<Heading
  text="An H2 that's comfortable in its own skin"
  level={2}
/>
```

Finally, what if there are areas of your project where it isn't practical to use
a custom component in lieu of traditional HTML tags? For instance, the project
for which I first wrote this component included a blog that pulled simple markup
from a CMS, and writing a custom renderer to replace every heading tag with this
component seemed like overkill. 

For these instances, I wound up using the same CSS-in-JS variables that we pull
into `Heading`, but scoping them directly to where I need them.

```js
// src/templates/blog-post.tsx
const blogBodyStyles = css`
  h2 {
    ${h2}
  }

  h3 {
    ${h3}
  }
  // etc.  
`

return (
  <div css={blogBodyStyles}>
    {renderedBlogBody}
  </div>
)
```

And there you have it: the flexibility to match your heading styles to any 
design while maintaining semantically correct HTML and clean CSS!
